!============================== v3r1 2013-04-18 ==============================

! 2013-04-17 - Jeroen van Leerdam
 - Removed test version of P2VV II (v3r0)
 - Added first P2VV II release (v3r1)

   Starting from release v3r0, P2VV is no longer an update of its first
   version. P2VV I is replaced by P2VV II, which is an entirely new
   framework. Like the first version, P2VV II is an analysis framework based
   on RooFit, primarily intended for decay time- and decay angle-dependent
   analyses of B -> V h^+ h^- decays. Currently, its only application is the
   analysis of the decay B_s^0 -> J/psi K^+ K^-.

   P2VV II implements a number of custom RooFit classes, which are used to
   build time- and angular-dependent probability density functions (PDFs).
   Configuration and PDF building is handled by classes, functions and
   scripts written in Python. PyROOT is used to interact with
   ROOT/RooFit/P2VV C++ classes.

   A new file/directory structure was created to use P2VV both stand-alone
   and as a package in the LHCb software framework. The root directory has
   the structure of an LHCb package, with the usual "cmt", "doc", "P2VV",
   "src" and "python/P2VV" subdirectories. The stand-alone version lives in
   the "standalone" directory.

   "standalone" has a Makefile and setup scripts. The C++ and Python code
   files are symlinks to their LHCb versions by default. If differences
   between the stand-alone and LHCb versions are required, symlinks can be
   replaced by real files.

 - P2VV/AngularAcceptanceCorrectionSet.h
  . Make accessors to Phis safe and name-independent.
  . Inline most methods.

  . Make dictionary for AngularAcceptanceCorrectionSet

! 2008-05-29 - Juan PALACIOS
 - Add P2VV/PdfMAkerFunctions.h, src/PdfMakerFunctions.cpp

    new templated AnglesAbsFunc<ThreeAngleProxy> base class.
 - dict/P2VVDict.h, P2VVDict.xml
  . Make dictionaries for functions in P2VV/PdfMakerFunctions.h

! 2008-05-28 - Juan PALACIOS
 - P2VV/ThreeAnglesProxy.h, P2VV/TwoAngleProxy.h, P2VV/OneAngleProxy.h
  . Fix copy constructors. RooRealProxies need to be copied in a special way.
 - P2VV/AnglesAbsFunc.h
  . Call new AnglesProxy copy constructors.
  . make m_usePhi and m_Phi private and add protected by-reference accessors.
 - src/TransF*.cpp, HelF*.cpp
  . Use new accessors for m_phi and m_usePhi (see above)
  . Optimise the analiticalIntegral methods a bit.
 - P2VV/OneAngle.h, P2VV/TwoAngles.h, P2VV/ThreeAngles.h
  . Inline angle accessor methods.

! 2008-05-27 - Juan PALACIOS
 - ThreeAngles, TwoAngles, OneAngle classes now are simple holders for 3, 2 and
   1 RooRealVars representing the corresponding angles. No parent is involved,
   the classes are standalone, and have accessors to references to the data.

 - Add P2VV::OneAngleProxy, P2VV::TwoAngleProxy.h, P2VV::ThreeAngleProxy
   . These classes are constructed from a OneAngle, TwoAngles or ThreeAngles
     respectively, plus a pointer to a RooAbsReal parent. The RooRealVar data
     from the simple Angles classes are used to construct RooRealProxies, with
     the parent pointer used for ownership. These are used internally by all
     derived classes of AbsAnglesFunc (HelFX and TransFX).

 - P2VV/AnglesAbsFunc.h, src/AnglesAbsFunc.cpp
   . Modify to be templated on one of the new AnglesProxy classes, while
     taking a simple Angles type in the constructor.

 - P2VV/HelF*.h, P2VV/TransF*.h
  . Modify to adapt to changes related to new AnglesProxy classes. Concretely,
    these classes are now all public AnglesAbsFunc<P2VV::ThreeAngleProxy>.

 - dict/P2VVDict.h, dict/P2VV.xml
  . Make dicitonaries for the new P2VV::OneAngleProxy, P2VV::TwoAngleProxy and
    P2VV::ThreeAngleProxy classes.
  . Fix a bunch of other problems with the dictionaries.

! 2008-05-26 - Tristan Arnoldus DU PREE
 - Removed AngularAcceptanceCorretions.{h,cpp}
  . Inheritance from RooAbsReal was unnecessary. phi(unsigned int) was possibly dangerous.
 - Added AngularAcceptanceCorrectionSet.{h,cpp}
  . Is a RooArgSet which can return the (6 phi) RooRealVars it takes as argument. Removed the -possibly dangerous- functions which take unsigned ints as arguments.

! 2008-05-13 - Tristan Arnoldus DU PREE
 - ThreeAngles, TwoAngles, OneAngle classes
  . Added these classes which hold {3,2,1} classes
 - AnglesAbsFunc<xAngles>

  . Fixed minor bugs (int==double), removed inheritance from RooAbsReal

 - src/AnglesAbsFunc.cpp
	. Changed _usePhi(false) to _usePhi(true) in 6 argument constructor of AnglesAbsFunc(name, title, 3 angles, Phi).

! 2008-04-04 - Juan PALACIOS
 - src/TransF5.cpp
  . Fix typo in THREEANGLES::FFSS::TransF5::analyticalIntegral(Int_t code,const char* range) const

! 2008-01-25 - Juan PALACIOS

 -  P2VV/TransF*.h, P2VV/HelF*.h (and corresponding .cpp files in src/)
  . Put all TransF* and HelF* classes unsed P2VV::THREEANGLES::FFSS namespace.

 - src/P2VVPdfMakerFunctions.cpp, dict/P2VVDict.xml
  . Adapt to new P2VV::THREEANGLES::FFSS namespaces (see above)

 - P2VV/AnglesAbsFunc.h, src/AnglesAbsFunc.cpp
  . Add five parameter constructor:
     AnglesAbsFunc::AnglesAbsFunc(const char *name, 
                                  const char *title,
                                  RooRealVar& cpsi, 
                                  RooRealVar& ctheta, 
                                  RooRealVar& phi);
 - cmt/requirements
  . Prepare for ROOT 5.18. libRooFit has been split into libRooFitCore and
    libRooFit. Link to both of these.

 - P2VV/TransF*.h, P2VV/HelF*.h (and corresponding .cpp files in src/)
  . Add five parameter constructor, simply calls AnglesAbsFunc five parameter
