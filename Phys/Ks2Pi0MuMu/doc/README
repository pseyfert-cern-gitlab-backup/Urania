NTuples created using Erasmus package Phys/Ks2Pi0MuMuTuples

This package is used to

(Optional)
--------------
(+ Merge the ntuple job outputs: 
   kspi0mumu_merger.py (MC) or kspi0mumu_mergerTChain.py (data)
   VC just uses hadd)

Prepare for MVA training
--------------
+ Add variables (masses, hel angles) and split file for training and testing: 
  warmup.py

MVA training
--------------
+ Add the GL-zed variables: 
  Save_GL.py

+ Run TMVA:   
  TMVA_GL_Kspi0.py 
  (files saved in ../../operators, can be moved to ./weights)
    
After MVA training
------------------
+ Create the functions that make the signal response to be flat 
  and add the MVA variables to the ntuple: 
  cooldown.py

Fitting
-------
+ Fit: 
  fit_RooFit.py
