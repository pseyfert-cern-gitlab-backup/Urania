==== Get the package
  setenvErasmus v6r1
  SetupProject Erasmus v6r1
  getpack Phys/Bs2MuMu head 
  cd Phys/Bs2MuMu/src 

==== Compile it 
 I usually compile with a newer version of root: 

   source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.3.5/x86_64-slc5/setup.sh; 
   source  /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.32.02/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh;
   
   make work; 
   make calca; 

==== Generate the workspace 
   Fake data: 
   ./work     
   Other data: 
   ./work -in inputfile.txt
   Add constraints also:        
   ./work -prior
   
==== Use "calca " code: 


     ./calca 
     options: 
     -b       batch mode
     -bs N    Add N bs fake events to the dataset
     -bd N    Add N bd fake events to the dataset 
     -var X   X=0 fit both Nbs and Nbd    
     	      X=1 fit only bs
	      X=2 fit only bd
     -bin N   number of bins to be scanned 
     	      (note if you fit both bs and bd the real points scanned will be N^2)
     -trial abc   where abc is an additional name to distinguish different runs
     -C       if the workspace has constraints... in order to use them.
