! Package     : PIDCalib/CalibDataScripts
! Responsible : Andrew Powell
! Purpose     : Scripts to generate PID Calibration samples
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

! 2013-03-29 - Philip Hunt
  - Removed redundant CalibDataScripts_v2, src_v2 and config directories,
    and all files within these directories

! 2013-03-24 - Juan Martin Otalora Goicochea
  - added jobs and scripts for MagDown 2012 and 2011 data 
  - modified getRunLumi.py to initialize the fileSuffix variable
  - added ReducePIDCalibNtuple.C to copy an ntuple with reduced number of colums.
    This is necessary to  obtain reference samples for systematics study.

! 2013-03-12 - Juan Martin Otalora Goicochea
  - added/modified all the scripts and job files for the muon side in CalibDataScripts/jobs/MUON
    to be compatible with the changes from Philip
  - modified MuonProbTagTrigger.C to include the itegrated luminosity ntuple 

! 2013-03-12 - Philip Hunt
  - pickle files have been renamed to reflect the fact that the muon calibration requires different luminosity divisions to the standard D* and Lam0 calibration
    - scripts/python/chopTrees.py and scripts/python/getRunLumi.py
  - minor change to scripts/python/uploadData.py to minimise the number of attempts to upload a file
  - added scripts/python/uploadData_refSamples.py to upload reference samples used by the systematic studies to Grid storage

!============================== v2r0 19-02-2012 ==============================

! 2013-03-02 - Juan Martin Otalora Goicochea
    - changes in src/JpsiFit.cpp, Lam0Fit_MuonUnBiased.cpp, DStFit_MuonUnBiased.cpp,
      to be compatibles with the other objects
    - scripts/python/chopTrees.py: added arguments tree_lists and gangadir.
    - jobs/Stripping20/ganga_gp_chopTrees_Mag{Up,Down}: modified to be compatible with
      new chopTrees.py
    - Added directory jobs/MUON to put muon jobs
    - Added new jobs for muons: jobs/MUON/Stripping{19a,20}
    - Added scripts scripts/root/MuonProbTagTrigger.C and
      scripts/python/MuonProbTagTriggerProcess.py
      wich run over a given ganga job from CalibDataSel. Select prob and tag Muons.
      Apply TIS cut and reduce number of columns. Put the results in a gangadir fake job
    - Added ganga job jobs/MUON/Stripping20/MuonTabProb/ganga_muon_tab_prob_Mag{Up, Down}.py

! 2013-02-19 - Andrew Powell (LHCb)04
 - Make version v2r0

! 2013-02-19 - Andrew Powell (LHCb)04
  - Added python script scripts/python/uploadData.py
    - Uploads calibration RooDataSets onto CERN-USER SE using the Dirac command
      'dirac-dms-add-files'
  - Added pickle files containing run number limits for S17 data

! 2013-02-06 - Juan Martin Otalora Goicochea
  - Modified ChopUpMuonTrees.cpp to consider the tag and prob flags as boolean
  - Modified JpsiFit.h, Lam0Fit_MuonUnBiased.h and DStFit_MuonUnBiased.h to remove 
    the hasRich cut as suggested by andrew and to add the "_" character in the trigger variables.
  - Removed getRunNumberLimits.C. We will use getRunLumi.py

! 2013-01-28 - Andrew Powell
  - Fixed bug in scripts/python/getRunLumi.py
    - for loops were running over lists upRuns and downRuns, respectively. These
      should have been the sorted varients upRunNumbers and downRunNumbers. 
      Fortunately, this does not effect the run numbers obtained for S20 last 
      week. 

! 2013-01-23 - Andrew Powell
  - Modifications and Clean up
    - src/{DStFit,K0SFit,LambdaFit}.cpp all updated to consider data distributed 
      across multiple ganga jobs (or from any source for that matter). 
    - Removed redundant shell job scripts 

! 2013-01-21 - Andrew Powell
  - Modifications to scripts/python/getRunLumi.py
    - Now ensure that the run blocks are guaranteed to have a luminosity LESS
      than the request value. Not done previously.

! 2012-11-23 - Andrew Powell
  - Major updates
    - scripts/python/getRunLumi.py: now saves a pickle file of 2 x N numpy array 
      containing the min and max run numbers for each run block corresponding to 
      the luminosity set by the user
    - scripts/python/chopTrees.py: script that takes the above mentioned pickle 
      files and splits the nTuples for each subjob of a given ganga job into 
      sub-files accorsding to the run limits
    - jobs/Stripping20/ChopTrees/ganga_gp_chopTrees_Mag{Up,Down}.py: ganga 
      scripts that run chopTrees.py through the GaudiPython application

! 2012-11-17 - Andrew Powell
  - Updated scripts/getRunLumi.py
    - Now prints a user friendly array to screen 

! 2012-10-31 - Andrew Powell
  - Changes implemented for S20 processing
    - src/{DStFit,K0SFit,LambdaFit}.cpp all updated for using 2012 event variables
  - Updates to Dirac scripts
    - All common functions now located in scripts/diracFuncs.py
    - Weeded dead code from scripts/getRunLumi.py
    - Added new script scripts/getTCKLumi.py
      - Determines the luminosity within defined run ranges associated with a specific
        TCK. Used to study the concerns possed by Vava Gligorov during Oct '12 Analysis
        week that the rate of D* accumulated per pb^-1 may vary with trigger TCK

! 2012-10-01 - Andrew Powell
  - Updated scripts/getRunLumi.py

    DataSets for Muon Unbiased Lines
  - Added MergeProtonLines_MuonUnBiased.cpp to merge proton DataSets
  - Modified MergeCharges.cpp to include the Muon DataSets 
  - Modified SetSpectatorVars.h to include method SetSpecVars_EvtVars2012 wich contais 
    runNumber ranges corresponding to 2012 data

! 2012-07-05 - Andrew Powell
  - Corrected extendedMod argument in all PerformDMassBinnedFit() and 
	  PerformDMassIterativeBinnedFit() functions to be kTRUE (previously set to kFALSE 
    incorrectly)
  - Many thanks to Juan Martin OtÃ¡lora Goicochea for indentifying this issue

	    - isMuon, isMuonLoose, nShared, InMuonAc
    - Minor mods to ChopTrees
      - Job script split into _MagUp and _MagDown scripts 

! 2011-12-08 - Andrew Powell
  - Added scripts/getRunLumi.py
    - python script kindly provided by Marco Adinolfi to determine the run numbers and
      their associated offline luminosities for both magentic field polarities
    - Usage:
      - Ensure you have a valid grid proxy
      > SetupLHCbDirac
      > python -u getRunLumi.py Collision11 Stripping17
  - Added src/ChopUpTrees.cpp on behalf of Sneha Malde. 
	  - Exectuable to split the ganga subjob nTuples into sub-nTuples according to a 
      given list of run ranges defined within an input file: RUNNUMBERS_{DOWN,UP}.txt.
  - Modified Lambda0 fit to use RooPhysFitter::RooDMassFitter::MakeDMassSigTriGauss().
    - Now fit a triple-Guassian instead of just a double-Gaussian.
  - Updated job scripts for Stripping17 data.

! 2011-11-14 - Philip Hunt
  - Added support for making data set from input files in a directory other
    than the ganga directory.
  - Fix to bug in fitting scripts in which the output directory was not set to the
    input directory if an empty string was specified.
 
! 2011-11-11 - Andrew Powell
  - Major changes made to package structure.
  - PROBLEM: The generation of the packge library, needed by most of the src_v2 applications, was 
    causing errors in the nightly builds which use the following make command:
     > make CMTEXTRATAGS=use-distcc,no-pyzip -j 30
    Standard 'cmt make' does not use the parallel build like above, and so makes the package 
    sequently. Consequently, the library existed when compiliing the src_v2 executables. 
  - SOLUTION: The library needed by the src_v2 applications is now made in the CalibDataProduction 
    package, which this package now depends upon.  

! 2011-11-07 - Philip Hunt
  - Added scripts in src_v2 to split the phi data sets into regions of track momentum
    and eta, and to merge the results after fitting. Updated src_v2/MakeDataSets.cpp to
    include methods to do the merging and splitting.

! 2011-11-06 - Andrew Powell
  - Removed tight mass cut applied in MergedCharges.cpp: 
    - This was a bug since this clearly effects the sum of weights and means Sum_i w_i != N_sig.
    - Consequently the datasets were not being weighted correctly.

! 2011-11-02 - Philip Hunt
  - Added scripts in src_v2 to split data sets into regions of track momentum,
    and to merge the results after fitting. Updated src_v2/MakeDataSets.cpp to
    include methods to do the merging and splitting.

! 2011-11-01 - Andrew Powell
  - Updated package to use new RooPhysFitter methods:
    - RooDMassFitter::PerformDMassIterativeBinnedFit
    - RooDstarD0MassFitter::PerformDelmIterativeBinnedFit
  - Fits are now configured to use the following sequence of MINUIT fit strategies:
    - non-D*: 0,2
    - D*    : 0,1

! 2011-10-27 - Philip Hunt
  - Updated src_v2/MergePhiDataSets.cpp to remove the cut on the mass prior to
    merging, as this was messing up the DLL distribution
  -
! 2011-10-19 - Andrew Powell
  - Minor modifications to perform fits over nTuples from uDST (Stripping17)
    + nTracks variable no longer exists (use nLong only from now on)
    + nPV variable now called nPVs
    + SetSpecVars_mDSTEvtVars() in SetSpectatorVars.h accounts for these changes
      and is now used instead of SetSpecVars_EvtVars() in DStFit.cpp, Lam0Fit.cpp 
      and K0SFit.cpp

! 2011-10-10 - Sneha Malde
  - Modified making the data set so that it conforms to the latest changes in
    RooPhysFitter.
  - The D* fit now uses the new double fit formulation with also some fixed
    bkg variables

! 2011-09-29 - Philip Hunt
  - Implementations of methods in CalibDataScripts_v2/MakeDataSets.h have now been moved to
  - src_v2/MakeDataSets.cpp 
  - Fixed bug in new fitting code which meant that extended fits were not performed
  - Fixed bug in new fitting code which meant that merging workspaces with PDFs did not update
    the range of the yield variables
  - New phi fitting now uses the same background PDF as used in the phi cross-section
    analysis 
  - Modified new merging code so that tracks with different charges can be stored in 
    separate data sets (previously, all tracks of a given type were stored in the same data set,
    with a RooCategory specifying the track charge).

! 2011-09-29 - Andrew Powell
  - $GANGAREPOS variable now set within package requirements file.

! 2011-09-15 - Sneha Malde
  - Modified file path string to use env. variable $GANGAREPOS. The user needs to 
    set this environment to point to the correct location.

! 2011-09-13 - Andrew Powell
  - Updates to package for generating calibration samples from stripping15 data
  - Added a new file for filtering the charm 14nb^-1 inc. phi ntuples:
    + src_v2/CharmXsec_PhiStrip.cpp
      and associated batch/ganga scripts:
    + jobs/Charm14nb_PhiStrip.csh, jobs/CharmXsec
  - Updated batch submission scripts so one single job process all the data for 
    a given track type from a given parent particle. The master scripts are now:
    + jobs/DStJob.sh
    + jobs/Lam0Job.sh
    + jobs/K0SJobs.sh
  - Added ganga scripts for stripping15 in jobs/Stripping15

! 2011-09-08 - Philip Hunt
  - Major changes to the package including:
    o New ConfParser class added to parse configuration files, as well as 
      modification of the relavent files to check configuration settings from
      an input configuration file. This allows to the user to configure 
      settings such as the tuple names and ganga jobs repository directory
      which were previously hard-coded, allowing the user to change these
      settings without having to edit the source files;
    o New JobSplitter.cpp source file added to produce configuration files 
      in which Ganga subjobs can be processed in batches (useful for very
      large input datasets);
    o Enums.h file added, containing various enumerations, such as charge,
      polarity and track type, which are used by the various calibration
      scripts;
    o The majority of functions have now been moved to MakeDataSets.h.
      The calibration scripts such as the data set production and fitting
      scripts now use common functions in this file, minimising the amount
      of code repetition.
  - For the moment, only Phi, Lamda0 and KS0 source files have been produced,
    but the functions in MakeDataSets.h are also able to process D*+ decays.
  - config directory has been added, which contains a default configuration 
    file, and configuration files for processing the 14nb-1 charm calibration
    data.
  - The new code is kept separate from the old code for the moment in order not
    to intefere with the code being used for other analyses.
     o Header files can be found in CalibDataScript_v2;
     o Source files can be found in src_v2. 

! 2011-09-07 - Andrew Powell
  - Updates to package for generating calibration samples from stripping13b data
  - Jobs scripts {DStJob, Lam0Job, K0SJob}.csh now:
    o Fit sample for given calibration track and generate associated fit plots;
    o Output a separate dataset, with sWeights, for each track charge;
    o Merge the +ve and -ve datasets into a combined dataset with charge as a RooCategory.
