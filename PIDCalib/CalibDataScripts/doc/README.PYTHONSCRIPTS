In order to use several of the python scripts, including getRunLumi.py and
uploadData.py, you need to setup the environment for LHCbDirac.
Furthermore, you will need to include several external (LCG) packages
in the enviroment.
You can do this (in a clean environment) by sourcing the shell script
"scripts/setenv_dirac.(c)sh".
