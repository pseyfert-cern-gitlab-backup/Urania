#the '!' means "plot but don't cut"
!B_P>			0		1.0e5		5.0e3
#the ! also works with the full entries in the list

#the 'cut' can be anything:
B_P-B_PT*5.0^1>		-1.0e5		1.0e5		5.0e3		
#but there can be no white space in the cut.. 
#this cut is rather odd, but you get the idea.

#the lower and upper bound can be in any order
#B_DMASS_B0<		500		250		50
#is the same as
B_DMASS_B0<		250		500		50
#but running with both would be a little pointless, so I commented one out

#you can have as many cuts/plots as you want.
#all of the parameters must appear as they are in the root file
#see the file list_vars.txt to generate the list of variables automatically
