# FT/Espresso

The Espresso package is a set of classes for calculating and performing flavour tagging calibrations.
Several types of calibration models are supported (including polynomials and splines and different link functions).
A common XML format is specified for saving/loading calibrations.
Finally, a class RooGLMFunction allows for integration into RooFit.
