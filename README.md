# The URANIA project

Urania is, together with [Erasmus](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Erasmus), the high-level physics analysis software repository (or collection of packages used by various working groups) for the LHCb experiment, based on heptools. 

## How to work with Urania

For development purposes of any of the packages hosted under Urania, please follow the [instructions](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/Git4LHCb#Satellite_projects) at the Git4LHCb twiki.

In any case, there are two important rules you must remember:

1. <b>Never clone the whole project for development purposes.</b> Please follow the instructions above.
2. <b>Always checkout the packages from the master branch.</b> If not, when asking for a Merge Request (MR), incompatibilities will appear and thus the MR will be closed. 

Apart from project maintainers, also certain package maintainers are allowed to accept and revert MR. These people are marked with [] on the [requirements](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Urania/blob/master/UraniaSys/cmt/requirements) file.
